# ROS Action client & custom (srv,msg,launch) files

## Overview
1. **Action Client Node**: A client node that interacts with the `/reaching_goal` action server to set a target goal (x, y) and move the robot to the target while providing feedback.
2. **Service to Track Last Target**: A service node that tracks the last target goal sent to the robot and responds with the last known target coordinates.
3. **Custom Message for Position and Velocity**: A subscriber listens to the robot's odometry data and publishes a custom message with the robot's position and velocity.
4. **Launch File**: A launch file that brings together multiple nodes for a coordinated execution.

## Nodes

### 1. `action_client.py`
- **Purpose**: The action client interacts with the `PlanningAction` server to set and send goals for the robot to reach. It publishes the robot's position and velocity and also handles canceling the goal if the user presses 'c'.
- **Topics**:
  - Subscribes to `/odom` to receive robot's odometry data.
  - Publishes to `/robot_pos_vel` to send the robot's position and velocity as a `Custom_msg`.
- **Services**: None

### 2. `last_target_service.py`
- **Purpose**: This service node tracks and returns the last target coordinates set for the robot. It listens to the `/reaching_goal/goal` topic and updates the stored coordinates.
- **Services**:
  - `Last_target`: Returns the last target coordinates as `float64` values for `x` and `y`.
- **Topics**:
  - Subscribes to `/reaching_goal/goal` to listen for new goals.

## Launch File
The launch file integrates the following nodes:
- `wall_follow_service.py`: A node for following a wall.
- `go_to_point_service.py`: A node for navigating to a target.
- `bug_as.py`: A node implementing bug-based navigation.
- `action_client.py`: The action client that sends goal coordinates to the robot and tracks its progress.
- `last_target_service.py`: A service node for querying the last set target coordinates.

### Launch command:
```bash
roslaunch assignment_2_2024 assignment1.launch

Note: the user input is through the same terminal you launch from, but sometimes the prompt for inputing the velocity gets pushed up, in any case you can directly start inputing the linear velocity in the terminal once the envirment is loaded.
